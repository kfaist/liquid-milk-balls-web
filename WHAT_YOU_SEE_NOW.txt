WHICH TAB IS WHICH - LOOK AT THIS NOW!
======================================

YOU ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT:
------------------------------
FIREFOX TAB 79 - "Viewer - The Mirror's Echo"

THIS IS: YOUR OUTPUT (Processed Art)
URL: https://liquid-milk-balls-web-production-2e8c.up.railway.app/return-viewer.html

IF YOU SEE YOURSELF HERE:
- This is your PROCESSED video
- This is what the world sees
- TouchDesigner effects should be applied
- THIS IS YOUR PUBLIC ART OUTPUT!


WHERE IS YOUR INPUT (Raw Camera)?
----------------------------------
You need to open this in a NEW tab:

1. Press Ctrl+T (new tab)
2. Type: localhost:3000/publisher.html
3. Press Enter
4. Click "Start Camera"

THIS WILL SHOW: Your raw camera feed (before effects)


SIMPLE ANSWER:
--------------
RIGHT NOW you are looking at TAB 79 = OUTPUT (processed art)

To see INPUT (raw camera), open: localhost:3000/publisher.html in new tab


THE PIPELINE:
-------------
Publisher (localhost:3000/publisher.html) = INPUT (raw you)
    ↓
TouchDesigner = PROCESSING (adds effects)
    ↓
Return Viewer (Tab 79 - what you're seeing) = OUTPUT (art!)


IF YOU SEE YOURSELF IN TAB 79:
Your pipeline is WORKING! You're seeing the processed output!
