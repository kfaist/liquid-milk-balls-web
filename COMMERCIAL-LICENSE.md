# Commercial Licensing

This project is published under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3).

Commercial licensing is available for organizations that require a proprietary license, do not wish to comply with the AGPL network-copyleft terms, or need an exception (for example, to run a hosted service without publishing source).

To request a commercial license, pricing, or enterprise terms, contact:
- Email: licensing@yourdomain.com
- OR open an inquiry at: https://yourdomain.com/contact

Commercial license terms typically include:
- Permission to run a hosted version without releasing source under AGPLv3
- Warranty and indemnification options (optional, negotiated)
- SLA and support packages
- Per-seat or per-stream pricing and NDI relay credits

We can offer dual-licensing: the public repository remains AGPLv3, while commercial customers are granted a separate proprietary license.
