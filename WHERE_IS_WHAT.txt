WHERE TO SEE WHAT - SIMPLE GUIDE
================================

YOUR INPUT (Raw Camera):
------------------------
FIREFOX TAB 60 - Publisher
URL: http://localhost:3000/publisher.html

THIS SHOWS: Your raw camera feed
THIS IS: What you look like BEFORE TouchDesigner effects
YOU SHOULD SEE: Yourself, unprocessed


YOUR OUTPUT (Processed Art):
----------------------------
FIREFOX TAB 78 - Return Viewer
URL: https://liquid-milk-balls-web-production-2e8c.up.railway.app/return-viewer.html

THIS SHOWS: Your processed video with TouchDesigner effects
THIS IS: What the world sees - your interactive art!
YOU SHOULD SEE: Yourself WITH artistic effects applied


HOW TO CHECK EACH ONE:
----------------------

TO SEE INPUT (Raw You):
- Press Ctrl+1 in Firefox
- OR look for tab that says "Publisher"
- This is your RAW camera

TO SEE OUTPUT (Processed Art):
- Look for tab that says "Viewer" or "Return Viewer"
- This is your PROCESSED video with effects

WHICH ONE ARE YOU LOOKING AT NOW?
----------------------------------
Look at the tab title in Firefox:
- If it says "Publisher" = INPUT (raw camera)
- If it says "Viewer" or "Return Viewer" = OUTPUT (processed art)


THE DIFFERENCE:
---------------
INPUT (Tab 60) = You, normal, no effects
OUTPUT (Tab 78) = You, with TouchDesigner art effects

Your TouchDesigner applies effects to transform INPUT into OUTPUT!
