## 🚀 Next Steps to Get Your URL

Since this is an automated environment, you'll need to complete the final deployment steps manually:

### Option 1: Deploy via Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Accept your Railway invite**: https://railway.com/invite/v4BSx3LBApG
2. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard
3. **Create New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. **Select**: `kfaist/liquid-milk-balls-web`
5. **Select branch**: `copilot/set-up-live-site` (or main after merging)
6. Railway will auto-detect and deploy!
7. **Generate Domain** in settings to get your URL

### Option 2: Deploy via Railway CLI (On Your Local Machine)

```bash
# Login to Railway (opens browser)
railway login

# Link to your project from the invite
railway link

# Deploy the current directory
railway up

# Get your public URL
railway domain
```

## 📝 After Deployment

Once you have your Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`):

1. Update `config.js`:
   ```javascript
   window.SIGNALING_SERVER_URL = 'wss://your-app.up.railway.app';
   ```

2. Commit and push the config change

3. Deploy frontend to GitLab Pages/Vercel/Netlify

4. Test your live site! 🎉
