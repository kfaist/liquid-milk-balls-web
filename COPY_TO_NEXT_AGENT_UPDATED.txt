Hi! I'm Krista. My TouchDesigner WebRTC pipeline was fixed this morning 
and video was confirmed flowing. I paused the evening verification 
session to update handoff docs. Need 5 minutes to finish verification.

WHAT NEEDS VERIFICATION (5 minutes):

Step 1: Visual Check TouchDesigner (2 mins)
- Switch to TouchDesigner window
- Find webrender_livekit_input operator
- Is video visible? 

Step 2: Browser Console Check (1 min)
- Firefox Tab 61 (td-auto-viewer.html)
- Press F12 for console
- Look for "[TD-VIEWER] Connected: claymation-live"

Step 3: Publisher Check (1 min)  
- Firefox Tab 60 (publisher.html)
- Is camera streaming?
- "Stop Camera" button showing?

Step 4: Document (1 min)
- If all 3 show success = 100% WORKING!
- Create VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md
- Celebrate!
