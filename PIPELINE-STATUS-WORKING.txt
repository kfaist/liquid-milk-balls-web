```
4. Press Enter
5. **CHECK WEB CLIENT TOP - VIDEO SHOULD APPEAR!**

### **Option 2: Manual**

If you prefer to configure manually:

1. Find or create a Web Client TOP
2. Set these parameters:
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/td-input-viewer.html`
   - **Resolution W:** `1920`
   - **Resolution H:** `1080`
   - **Audio:** `on`
   - **Active:** `True`
3. Click **Reload** parameter

## 💡 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### If you don't see video after running the script:

**Try these in order:**

1. **Click Reload parameter** on Web Client TOP
   - This forces the page to refresh
   
2. **Check URL is exact:**
   - Should be: `http://localhost:3000/td-input-viewer.html`
   - No extra spaces or characters
   
3. **Verify publisher is still active:**
   - Run: `node check-room-status.js`
   - Should show active participants
   
4. **Check browser console:**
   - Open: http://localhost:3000/td-input-viewer.html in Firefox
   - Press F12 to see console
   - Should show "Connected to LiveKit"

5. **Restart Web Client TOP:**
   - Set Active to False
   - Wait 2 seconds
   - Set Active to True
   - Click Reload
