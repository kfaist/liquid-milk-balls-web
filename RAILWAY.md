# Railway Deployment Guide

## Deploy Unified HTTP+WebSocket Server to Railway

This guide will help you deploy the unified server (static files + WebSocket signaling) to Railway so you can access it from anywhere.

### Prerequisites

- A Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- Git installed on your machine
- This repository cloned locally

### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

The unified server is already configured to work with Railway:
- **Single Port**: Both HTTP (static files) and WebSocket (signaling at /ws) run on the same port
- **Health Check**: GET /healthz endpoint for Railway health monitoring
- **Auto-configuration**: Railway will automatically use the PORT environment variable
- **Config as Code**: railway.json specifies the start command and health check path

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: Deploy via Railway CLI

1. Install Railway CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

2. Login to Railway:
```bash
railway login
```

3. Initialize a new Railway project in the repository:
```bash
cd /path/to/liquid-milk-balls-web
railway init
```

4. Deploy the signaling server:
```bash
railway up
```

5. Get your deployment URL:
```bash
railway domain
```

#### Option B: Deploy via Railway Dashboard

1. Go to https://railway.app/new
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select this repository: `kfaist/liquid-milk-balls-web`
4. **Important**: Select the branch with the unified server (main or the merged branch)
5. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect it's a Node.js project
   - Use railway.json for configuration
   - Run `node server.js` as the start command
   - Enable health checks at /healthz
6. Once deployed, click "Generate Domain" to get a public URL

### Step 3: Configure Railway Service Settings

In your Railway project dashboard:

#### Deployment Source
- **Source**: GitHub → `kfaist/liquid-milk-balls-web`
- **Branch**: `main` (or the branch with the unified server)

#### Build System
- Leave as default (Nixpacks) - railway.json specifies this

#### Start Command
- Automatically picked up from railway.json: `node server.js`
- You can verify this in Settings → Deploy → Start Command

#### Health Check (Configured in railway.json)
- Path: `/healthz`
- This is automatically configured via railway.json
- You can verify it's working by visiting: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/healthz`

#### Sleep Mode (Optional)
- If you want WebSocket connections to stay available 24/7, disable sleep mode
- Settings → Service → Sleep Mode → Disable

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

After deploying to Railway, you'll get a URL like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

**No configuration changes needed!** The app is already configured to automatically detect the correct WebSocket URL:
- `config.js` now dynamically determines the WebSocket URL based on your current location
- On Railway (HTTPS): automatically uses `wss://your-app-name.up.railway.app/ws`
- On localhost (HTTP): automatically uses `ws://localhost:3000/ws`

### Step 4: Test the Deployment

#### A. Test HTTP (Static Files)
1. Open the root page: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
   - Should serve your interactive mirror website
2. Test health check: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/healthz`
   - Should return: `ok`

#### B. Test WebSocket (Signaling)
From a terminal:
```bash
npx wscat -c wss://your-app.up.railway.app/ws
```
- Should connect successfully
- Type a message and press enter
- Open another terminal and connect again - messages should relay between clients

#### C. Test WebRTC in Browser
1. Open `https://your-app.up.railway.app/` in your browser
2. Click "Start Camera" (grant camera permissions)
3. Click "Start WebRTC Call"
4. Status should show "Connected to signaling server"
5. Open another browser window/tab and repeat steps 2-3
6. You should establish a peer-to-peer WebRTC connection

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Railway automatically provides these variables:
- `PORT` - The port your app should listen on
- `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL` - Your app's public URL

No additional configuration needed!

### Monitoring

View logs in real-time:
```bash
railway logs
```

Or check the Railway dashboard for metrics and logs.

### Costs

Railway offers:
- **Hobby Plan**: Free tier with $5 credit/month (sufficient for signaling server)
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month for higher usage

The signaling server is very lightweight and should easily fit within the free tier for development/testing.

### Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: This signaling server is a simple relay without authentication. For production use, you should:

1. Add authentication (API keys, JWT tokens)
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add CORS protection
4. Use proper WebSocket security
5. Consider using a managed service like Twilio or PubNub for production

### Troubleshooting

**Connection fails:**
- Verify Railway deployment is running: Check Railway dashboard
- Ensure you're using `wss://` (not `ws://`) for the deployed URL
- Check browser console for error messages

**WebRTC not connecting:**
- The signaling server only relays messages
- WebRTC connections still use STUN/TURN servers
- For connections outside local network, you may need TURN servers

### Alternative: Quick Deploy Button

Add this to your GitHub README for one-click deployment:

### Next Steps

After deploying the signaling server:
1. Deploy the web app to GitLab Pages (already configured) or another host
2. Update `config.js` with your Railway WebSocket URL
3. Test the complete workflow with OBS and TouchDesigner
4. Share the deployed web app URL with others!
