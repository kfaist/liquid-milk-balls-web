# PASTE THIS TO NEXT CLAUDE SESSION

## Current Status - Mirror's Echo (Nov 26, 8:40 PM)

**What's Working:**
- ✅ TouchDesigner WebRender1 receiving video from `http://localhost:3000/td-input-viewer.html`
- ✅ Node.js server running on port 3000 with LiveKit endpoints
- ✅ LiveKit rooms configured (claymation-live for input, processed-output for output)
- ✅ Created fixed HTML page: `mirrors-echo-fixed.html` that connects to BOTH rooms

**What Needs Verification:**
- ❓ OBS streaming to LiveKit processed-output room via WHIP
- ❓ End-to-end test of mirrors-echo-fixed.html

**Two Problems Being Solved:**
1. WebRender stopped showing live page → FIXED (changed URL to localhost)
2. Website showing camera in BOTH windows → FIXED (created dual-room page)

**Key Files:**
- Project: `C:\Users\krista-showputer\Desktop\TD Projects\Backup\MOSTWORKING.toe`
- Server: `C:\Users\krista-showputer\Desktop\liquid-milk-balls-web\server\server.js`
- New Page: `C:\Users\krista-showputer\Desktop\liquid-milk-balls-web\mirrors-echo-fixed.html`
- Full Handover: `C:\Users\krista-showputer\Desktop\liquid-milk-balls-web\HANDOVER_NOV26_SESSION.md`

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify OBS is WHIP streaming to processed-output room
2. Test `http://localhost:3000/mirrors-echo-fixed.html`
3. User should see their camera on left, PROCESSED video on right

**Pipeline:**
Browser Camera → LiveKit (claymation-live) → TD WebRender → TD Effects → NDI → OBS → WHIP → LiveKit (processed-output) → Browser Processed Panel
