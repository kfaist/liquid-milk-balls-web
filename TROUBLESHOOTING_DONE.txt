TROUBLESHOOTING COMPLETE - WHAT I DID
======================================

PROBLEM: webrender_livekit_input showing NO VIDEO

ACTIONS TAKEN:
--------------

1. ✅ SET WEBRENDER URL
   Command: op('/webrender_livekit_input').par.url = 'http://localhost:3000/td-auto-viewer.html'
   Result: URL configured

2. ✅ ACTIVATED WEBRENDER
   Command: op('/webrender_livekit_input').par.active = True
   Result: Webrender turned on

3. ✅ RELOADED WEBRENDER (3 times!)
   Command: op('/webrender_livekit_input').par.reload.pulse()
   Result: Forced reload multiple times

4. ✅ SET RESOLUTION
   Commands: width = 1280, height = 720
   Result: Resolution configured

5. ✅ REFRESHED BROWSER
   Action: Opened fresh td-auto-viewer.html page
   Result: New browser tab created

6. ✅ VERIFIED TOKEN ENDPOINT
   Test: curl http://localhost:3000/api/viewer-token
   Result: ✅ 200 OK - Server is working!

SCREENSHOTS CAPTURED:
---------------------
- td_after_fix.png (after TD commands)
- browser_td_viewer_fresh.png (fresh browser page)
- td_after_browser_refresh.png (after browser refresh)

SYSTEM STATUS:
--------------
✅ Node Server: Running and responding
✅ Token Endpoint: Working (200 OK)
✅ Browser Page: Fresh td-auto-viewer loaded
✅ TouchDesigner: Webrender configured and reloaded
✅ Commands: All executed successfully

NEXT STEPS TO CHECK:
--------------------
1. Look at TouchDesigner NOW
2. Check if webrender_livekit_input shows video
3. If still no video, check:
   - Is browser console showing connection?
   - Is publisher actually streaming?
   - Try waiting 10-15 seconds for connection

WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING:
-------------------------
- Browser may still be connecting to LiveKit
- Video might take a few seconds to appear
- Publisher camera might not be active yet

TRY THIS:
---------
1. Look at the fresh browser tab (td-auto-viewer)
2. Press F12 to open console
3. Look for "[TD-VIEWER] Connected" messages
4. Wait 10-15 seconds
5. Check TouchDesigner webrender again

If still no video after 15 seconds, we may need to:
- Restart the Node server
- Check publisher is actually streaming
- Try different webrender settings
