## 🛠️ All Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Command |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **railway-readiness-check.sh** | Validate before deploy | `./railway-readiness-check.sh` |
| **health-check.sh** | Check local environment | `./health-check.sh` |
| **setup.sh** | Initial project setup | `./setup.sh` |

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Before Deploying
```bash
# Validate everything is ready
./railway-readiness-check.sh

# Should show: ✅ Ready with 1 warning(s)
# The warning about localhost is expected
```

### During Deployment
- **Follow NEXT-STEPS.md** section by section
- **Don't skip steps** - they build on each other
- **Check Railway logs** if something fails
- **Use the checklist** to track progress

### After Deployment
- **Save your URLs** in DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md
- **Test thoroughly** before sharing
- **Update config.js** with production URL
- **Monitor Railway** dashboard for issues

## 🚨 Common First-Time Mistakes

### ❌ Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
**Fix:** Ensure frontend is deployed to hosting with HTTPS

### ❌ Using WS instead of WSS
**Fix:** Change `ws://` to `wss://` in config.js for production

### ❌ Forgetting to Update config.js
**Fix:** After Railway deployment, update config.js with new URL

### ❌ Not Waiting for Deployment
**Fix:** Wait for Railway to show "Active" status before testing

### ❌ Camera Permissions Denied
**Fix:** Must use HTTPS and grant permissions in browser

## 🎬 The 5-Minute Quick Start

If you're experienced with deployments:

```bash
# 1. Check readiness
./railway-readiness-check.sh

# 2. Accept invite and deploy via CLI
railway login
railway link  # Link to project from invite
railway up    # Deploy
railway domain  # Get URL

# 3. Update config
# Edit config.js: wss://your-app.up.railway.app

# 4. Deploy frontend
# Push to GitLab/Vercel/Netlify

# 5. Test
# Open frontend URL → Start camera → Connect
```

## 📞 Need Help?

### Check These First
1. **Railway logs**: `railway logs` or in dashboard
2. **Browser console**: F12 → Console tab
3. **Readiness check**: `./railway-readiness-check.sh`
4. **Troubleshooting sections** in NEXT-STEPS.md

### Common Solutions
- **Connection fails**: Check you're using `wss://` not `ws://`
- **Build fails**: Check Railway logs for error details
- **Camera fails**: Use HTTPS and grant permissions
- **Peer fails**: May need TURN servers for some networks

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

✅ Railway shows deployment as "Active"
✅ Frontend loads without errors
✅ "Start Camera" shows your camera feed
✅ "Start WebRTC Call" shows "Connected to signaling server"
✅ Second browser window can connect as peer
✅ Both windows show video feeds
