# PASTE TO NEXT SESSION

## Mirror's Echo - Nov 26, 9:34 PM

**What's configured:**
- ✅ WebRender URL set to production: `https://liquid-milk-balls-web-production-2e8c.up.railway.app/td-input-viewer.html`
- ✅ Enable Media Stream: On
- ✅ mirrors-echo-fixed.html deployed (dual room: camera + processed output)
- ✅ LiveKit has active video publishers in claymation-live room
- ✅ OBS is streaming to processed-output room

**Current issue:**
WebRender loads td-input-viewer.html and shows a green status bar, but video area is BLACK despite active publishers. Need to debug why video isn't displaying.

**Key insight from this session:**
WebRender must load from PRODUCTION Railway URL (not localhost) because remote users publish to LiveKit cloud. The correct URL is td-input-viewer.html which auto-connects and subscribes to video.

**Project:** `C:\Users\krista-showputer\Desktop\TD Projects\Backup\MOSTWORKING.2.toe`

**To test:**
1. Open in browser: `https://liquid-milk-balls-web-production-2e8c.up.railway.app/td-input-viewer.html`
   - Should auto-connect and show remote video
2. If works in browser but not WebRender, issue is with WebRender browser engine

**Quick TD Textport commands:**
```python
print(op('/webrender1').par.url.val)  # Check URL
op('/webrender1').par.reload.pulse()   # Force reload
```
