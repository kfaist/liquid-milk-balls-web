# Dual Licensing Information

This project is dual-licensed: **AGPL-3.0-or-later** for open-source use. Commercial licensing and alternative licensing arrangements are available — contact **kristabluedoor@gmail.com** for details.

## Open Source License (AGPL-3.0-or-later)

The project is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later). This is a copyleft license that requires:

- Any modifications to the code must be released under the same license
- If you use this software to provide a network service (such as a SaaS application), you must make the complete source code available to users of that service
- Full license text is available in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file

### SaaS Implications

The AGPL's network copyleft provision is particularly important for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) deployments:

- If you run a modified version of this software as a web service or SaaS platform, users who interact with the service over a network must be able to receive the complete corresponding source code
- This includes all modifications and additions you've made to the original codebase
- Simply making the code available internally is not sufficient; it must be accessible to external users of the service

## Commercial License

Commercial licensing is available for organizations that:

- Cannot or do not wish to comply with the AGPL's copyleft requirements
- Need to use this software in proprietary applications
- Want to run hosted services without open-sourcing their modifications
- Require custom licensing terms, warranties, or support arrangements
