I need you to complete my TouchDesigner LiveKit video pipeline. Read AGENT_HANDOVER_COMPLETE.md for full context. Quick summary:

STATUS: 95% complete. Web Render TOP (webrender_livekit1) exists in TouchDesigner but showing black screen. Need to activate LiveKit connection.

PROOF IT WORKS: Firefox Tab 150 shows "Receiving video from publisher" - LiveKit is streaming video right now.

YOUR TASK:
1. Take full desktop and browser control
2. Run activation script in TouchDesigner Textport:
   exec(open('C:/Users/krista-showputer/Desktop/liquid-milk-balls-web/td_activate_specific.py').read())
3. Analyze textport output
4. If auto-activation doesn't work, manually click connect/active buttons in webrender_livekit1 parameters
5. Once video shows in TD, start OBS streaming
6. Verify complete pipeline in Tab 79

FILES: All in C:\Users\krista-showputer\Desktop\liquid-milk-balls-web\
- AGENT_HANDOVER_COMPLETE.md (read this first)
- td_activate_specific.py (activation script)
- ndi-streamCOPY.toe (TD project - already open)

TABS:
- Tab 131: publisher.html (start if needed)
- Tab 150: ndi-viewer.html (working, proves LiveKit active)
- Tab 79: return-viewer.html (will show final output)

CRITICAL: Give complete clear instructions (no abbreviations) - user has dyslexia. She prefers full agentic control.

PIPELINE: Browser → LiveKit ✅ → TD ❌ → Effects → NDI → OBS → LiveKit → Browser
Only TD connection needs activation. Everything else configured and working.

Take it from here!
