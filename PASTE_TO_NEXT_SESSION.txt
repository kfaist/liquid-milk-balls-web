# PASTE TO NEXT CLAUDE SESSION

## Mirror's Echo Status (Nov 26, 9:27 PM)

**Key Insight Discovered:** WebRender must load from PRODUCTION Railway URL, not localhost, because remote users publish cameras to LiveKit cloud.

**What's Done:**
- ✅ WebRender URL set to: `https://liquid-milk-balls-web-production-2e8c.up.railway.app/td-input-viewer.html`
- ✅ Created & deployed `mirrors-echo-fixed.html` - dual room page that:
  - Publishes camera to `claymation-live` (input room)  
  - Subscribes to `processed-output` (shows OBS processed video)
- ✅ OBS is actively streaming to processed-output room (`obs-whip-publisher` confirmed)
- ✅ LiveKit rooms have active video publishers

**What Needs Work:**
- ❓ WebRender video display needs verification
- ❌ `nvbackground1` shows red X (NVIDIA background removal error)
- ❓ End-to-end test of dual-room page

**Test This:**
Open: `https://liquid-milk-balls-web-production-2e8c.up.railway.app/mirrors-echo-fixed.html`
- Left panel = User's camera (publishing)
- Right panel = Processed video from OBS (subscribing)

**Project:** `C:\Users\krista-showputer\Desktop\TD Projects\Backup\MOSTWORKING.2.toe`

**Full Pipeline:**
```
Remote Browser Camera
    ↓ WebRTC publish
LiveKit "claymation-live"  
    ↓ WebRTC subscribe
TD WebRender (loads td-input-viewer.html from Railway)
    ↓ Processing
TD Effects → NDI Out
    ↓ NDI
OBS Studio
    ↓ WHIP
LiveKit "processed-output"
    ↓ WebRTC subscribe  
Browser "Processed" Panel (mirrors-echo-fixed.html)
```
