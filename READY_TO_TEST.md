# LIVEKIT IN TOUCHDESIGNER - READY TO TEST

## FIXED THE TOKEN ERROR!

The server now loads your LiveKit credentials from .env file.

## NEXT STEP:

**In Firefox, refresh the publisher page (press F5)**

Then click "Start Publishing" and you should see video in TouchDesigner!

## What's Working:
- Server with LiveKit tokens: ✅
- TouchDesigner Web Render TOP: ✅  
- Publisher page: ✅ (just needs refresh)

## The Flow:
Browser Camera → LiveKit → TD Web Render TOP → Your video processing!
