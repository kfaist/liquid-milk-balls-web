# NEXT SESSION - Mirror's Echo WORKING! 🎉

## What was fixed (Nov 26, 9:41 PM):
The production server was missing `/api/...` endpoints. Added them to server.js and pushed to Railway.

## Current state:
- ✅ WebRender receiving live video from remote publishers
- ✅ TD processing chain working (video → effects → output)
- ✅ All API endpoints deployed to production

## To test complete loop:
Open: `https://liquid-milk-balls-web-production-2e8c.up.railway.app/mirrors-echo-fixed.html`
- Left = your camera
- Right = processed output from OBS

## If issues:
1. Reload WebRender: `op('/webrender1').par.reload.pulse()` in TD Textport
2. Check OBS is streaming to processed-output room
